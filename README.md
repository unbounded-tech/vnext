# vnext

**vnext** is a fast Rust CLI tool that analyzes your project's Git commit history using conventional commit conventions to automatically compute your next semantic version. It streamlines release management by deciding whether to bump the major, minor, or patch version solely from commit messages, making it ideal for any project regardless of language or ecosystem.

## Motivation

Semantic-release is a powerful tool for automated versioning and changelog generation in the Node.js ecosystem, but it's tightly bound to Node and depends on the presence of a package.json, often introducing unnecessary overhead. While alternative tools exist, few offer the same streamlined experience. To address this gap, vnext was created—a lightweight, language-agnostic utility designed to parse Git commit messages and output the next semantic version. It adheres to the Unix philosophy of "do one thing well," making it an ideal choice for CI/CD pipelines across any tech stack.

## Features

Below is an enhanced explanation for the **Automated Version Calculation** feature, which you can include in your README:

---

- **Automated Version Calculation:**  
   vnext scans your Git commit history (starting from the last version tag) and examines each commit message using predefined regular expressions. It follows these rules:

   - **Major Version:**
      If a commit message contains `BREAKING CHANGE:` (in any commit type, such as `feat:`, `fix:`, or others) or is marked as a major change (with `major:`), vnext triggers a major version bump. This resets the minor and patch numbers.

   - **Minor Version:**  
      In the absence of major changes, if any commit message signals the introduction of a new feature—typically using the `feat:` prefix—vnext bumps the minor version and resets the patch number.

   - **Patch Version:**  
      If neither major nor minor changes are detected, but there’s at least one commit marked as a bug fix (usually indicated by `fix:`), vnext increments the patch version.

   - **No-Ops:**  
      Some commits (such as those labeled with `chore:`, `noop:`, or other non-functional changes) are ignored in the version calculation. These commits are treated as no-ops and do not trigger any version bump.

   This simple yet robust mechanism makes vnext ideal for integrating into CI/CD pipelines, regardless of the project’s language or ecosystem.
- **Language-Agnostic:**  
  No Node.js, npm, or package.json required – works with any codebase.
- **Simplicity First:**  
  Outputs just the next semantic version. Combine it with your preferred release process.
- **Unix Philosophy:**  
  A small, focused tool that does one thing well.

## Installation

### Using ubi

1. **Install ubi:**  
   Ensure you have ubi installed by running:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.ubi/bin
   echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.ubi/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc  # or your preferred shell profile
   ```
2. **Install vnext with ubi:**  
   ```bash
   ubi --project harmony-labs/vnext --in ~/.ubi/bin
   ```

### Building from Source

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harmony-labs/vnext.git
   cd vnext
   ```
2. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   # Standard build (uses system OpenSSL)
   cargo build --release
   
   # Build with vendored OpenSSL (standalone binary)
   cargo build --release --features vendored
   ```
   The compiled binary will be located at `target/release/vnext`.

   > **Note:** The `vendored` feature statically links OpenSSL, creating a standalone binary that works on systems without OpenSSL installed. This is recommended for distribution but increases build time.

## Usage

After installation or building from source, run:
```bash
vnext help
```
To compute the next version based on your Git commit history, simply run:
```bash
vnext
```
This will output the new semantic version, ready for use in your release pipelines.

## Developer Guide

### Building and Running

1. **Clone and Build:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harmony-labs/vnext.git
   cd vnext
   
   # For development (faster build)
   cargo build
   
   # For release with vendored OpenSSL
   cargo build --release --features vendored
   ```
2. **Run the Tool:**
   ```bash
   cargo run -- help
   ```
3. **Debugging:**
   Use the provided VSCode configuration in `.vscode/launch.json` to launch the debugger with breakpoints.

## Logging

vnext uses structured, colored logging similar to Cargo's output. By default, the log level is set to `info`. For more detailed logs, set:
```bash
export LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

## GitHub Actions & Release Automation

vnext is designed to integrate easily with CI/CD pipelines. For example, a GitHub Actions workflow could look like this:
```yaml
name: Release
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  version:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      - name: Install OpenSSL
        run: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y libssl-dev
        
      - name: Cache Rust dependencies
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: |
            ~/.cargo/registry
            ~/.cargo/git
            target
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-cargo-${{ hashFiles('**/Cargo.lock') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-cargo-
            
      - name: Calculate Next Version
        run: vnext
```
This snippet shows how to use vnext to compute the next version, which you can then use to tag your repository or drive further release steps.
