# vnext

**vnext** is a fast Rust CLI tool that analyzes your project's Git commit history using conventional commit conventions to automatically compute your next semantic version. It streamlines release management by deciding whether to bump the major, minor, or patch version solely from commit messages, making it ideal for any project regardless of language or ecosystem.

## Motivation

I used to rely on **semantic-release** in Node.js and was spoiled by its automation. However, semantic-release is tightly coupled to the Node ecosystem – it requires a `package.json` and brings a lot of extra overhead. I tried other tools, but none captured the simplicity I was after. That's why I built **vnext**: a lightweight, language-agnostic utility that focuses solely on reading Git commit messages and outputting the next semantic version. It follows the Unix philosophy of "do one thing well," making it perfect for CI/CD pipelines across any technology stack.

## Features

Below is an enhanced explanation for the **Automated Version Calculation** feature, which you can include in your README:

---

- **Automated Version Calculation:**  
   vnext scans your Git commit history (starting from the last version tag) and examines each commit message using predefined regular expressions. It follows these rules:

   - **Major Version:**
      If a commit message contains `BREAKING CHANGE:` (in any commit type, such as `feat:`, `fix:`, or others) or is marked as a major change (with `major:`), vnext triggers a major version bump. This resets the minor and patch numbers.

   - **Minor Version:**  
      In the absence of major changes, if any commit message signals the introduction of a new feature—typically using the `feat:` prefix—vnext bumps the minor version and resets the patch number.

   - **Patch Version:**  
      If neither major nor minor changes are detected, but there’s at least one commit marked as a bug fix (usually indicated by `fix:`), vnext increments the patch version.

   - **No-Ops:**  
      Some commits (such as those labeled with `chore:`, `noop:`, or other non-functional changes) are ignored in the version calculation. These commits are treated as no-ops and do not trigger any version bump.

   This simple yet robust mechanism makes vnext ideal for integrating into CI/CD pipelines, regardless of the project’s language or ecosystem.
- **Language-Agnostic:**  
  No Node.js, npm, or package.json required – works with any codebase.
- **Simplicity First:**  
  Outputs just the next semantic version. Combine it with your preferred release process.
- **Unix Philosophy:**  
  A small, focused tool that does one thing well.

## Installation

### Using ubi

1. **Install ubi:**  
   Ensure you have ubi installed by running:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.ubi/bin
   echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.ubi/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc  # or your preferred shell profile
   ```
2. **Install vnext with ubi:**  
   ```bash
   ubi --project harmony-labs/vnext --in ~/.ubi/bin
   ```

### Building from Source

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harmony-labs/vnext.git
   cd vnext
   ```
2. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```
   The compiled binary will be located at `target/release/vnext`.

## Usage

After installation or building from source, run:
```bash
vnext help
```
To compute the next version based on your Git commit history, simply run:
```bash
vnext
```
This will output the new semantic version, ready for use in your release pipelines.

## Developer Guide

### Building and Running

1. **Clone and Build:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harmony-labs/vnext.git
   cd vnext
   cargo build --release
   ```
2. **Run the Tool:**
   ```bash
   cargo run -- help
   ```
3. **Debugging:**
   Use the provided VSCode configuration in `.vscode/launch.json` to launch the debugger with breakpoints.

## Logging

vnext uses structured, colored logging similar to Cargo's output. By default, the log level is set to `info`. For more detailed logs, set:
```bash
export LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

## GitHub Actions & Release Automation

vnext is designed to integrate easily with CI/CD pipelines. For example, a GitHub Actions workflow could look like this:
```yaml
name: Release
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  version:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Calculate Next Version
        run: vnext
```
This snippet shows how to use vnext to compute the next version, which you can then use to tag your repository or drive further release steps.
