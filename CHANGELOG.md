* feat(formatting): indent commit bodies (#40)

  The changelog formatting has been enhanced to provide better readability for commit messages with multi-line bodies. This improvement is particularly valuable for complex commits such as squashed PRs from GitHub UI that contain multiple bullet points with extra lines between them.

  1. **Proper Indentation**: All lines in commit bodies are now indented with two spaces, creating a clear visual hierarchy between commit titles and their descriptions.

  2. **Empty Line Separation**: An empty line is added between the commit title and its body, providing clear visual separation.

  3. **Preserved Structure**: Empty lines within commit bodies are maintained to preserve the original structure and formatting of the message.

  4. **Optimized for Squashed PRs**: The formatting is optimized to handle GitHub UI squashed PRs, which typically include bullet points with extra lines between them.

  ```

  * feat: add new feature

  * feat(core): add support for custom plugins
  This is a squashed commit that includes the following changes:
  - feat(core): create plugin interface
  - feat(core): implement plugin loader
  - feat(core): add plugin discovery mechanism
  ```

  ```

    - feat(core): add plugin discovery mechanism
  ```

  The improved formatting is implemented in the `format_changelog` method in `src/version.rs`. The method now:

  1. Adds a bullet point to the first line of each commit message
  2. Adds an empty line between the commit title and body
  3. Indents all non-empty lines in the body with two spaces
  4. Preserves empty lines within the body to maintain the original structure
  5. Skips leading empty lines in the body to avoid extra newlines

  This enhancement makes changelogs more readable and visually appealing, especially for projects that use conventional commits and follow semantic versioning practices.

* fix(deps): update rust crate serde_json to v1.0.142 (#42)

  Co-authored-by: renovate[bot] <29139614+renovate[bot]@users.noreply.github.com>

* fix: breaking change detection, readme updates (#43)

  This commit fixes a bug in the BREAKING CHANGE detection logic where any occurrence 
  of "BREAKING CHANGE:" in a commit message would trigger a major version bump, even 
  if it appeared in the middle of a line or in a line that wasn't the first line of 
  the commit body.

  The fix modifies the regex pattern in constants.rs to only match "BREAKING CHANGE:" 
  when it appears at the start of the first line of the commit body (immediately after 
  the commit title and an empty line). This ensures that only intentional breaking 
  changes trigger a major version bump, not mentions of breaking changes in 
  documentation or other contexts.

  Changes:
  - Updated BREAKING_REGEX_STR in constants.rs to use a more specific pattern
  - Added comprehensive test cases in tests/integration_test.rs
  - Updated unit tests in git.rs to match the new behavior
  - Updated README.md to clarify how BREAKING CHANGE detection works

  This change maintains compatibility with conventional commits specification while 
  preventing false positives that could lead to unintended major version bumps.

* feat: enable github integration when repo has github remote (#47)

  Automatically enables the GitHub contributor information in changelogs when:
  1. The repository is hosted on GitHub (detected from remote URL)
  2. The --changelog flag is enabled

  This improves the user experience by providing GitHub contributor information without requiring the --github flag to be explicitly set for GitHub repositories.

  - Modified main.rs to detect GitHub repositories and auto-enable the flag
  - Added tests for GitHub repository detection
  - Updated documentation to reflect the new behavior
  - Made GitHub module and extract_repo_info function public in the library

  * feat: rm github flag, detection by remote is enough

  * chore: correct readme github flag info

* feat: generate-deploy-key command (#53) (by @patrickleet)

  This adds a new subcommand to vnext that simplifies setting up deploy keys for GitHub repositories:
    
    - Automatically detects current repository owner and name when possible
    - Generates an Ed25519 SSH key pair
    - Sets the private key as a GitHub repository secret
    - Adds the public key as a deploy key to the repository
    - Provides improved error handling and user prompts
    - Includes comprehensive documentation in README
    
    This feature is particularly useful for CI/CD workflows where the default GITHUB_TOKEN
    cannot trigger other workflows, such as when using the shared workflow at
    unbounded-tech/workflow-vnext-tag.

* feat: changelog header scaling (#54) (by @patrickleet)

  Scales headers from commit bodies when creating the changelog so they look nicer in relation to the release notes h3 title. H1, H2, and H3 are scaled down three sizes to H4, H5, and H6, respectively.

* feat: implement flexible commit parser architecture (#81) (by @patrickleet)

  Introduces a parser architecture for analyzing commit messages with multiple strategies:

  ##### Parser Strategies

  - **Conventional Commits Parser**: Implements the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for structured commit messages
  - **Custom Regex Parser**: Enhanced with configurable regex patterns for flexible parsing

  ##### Key Improvements

  - **Factory Pattern**: Added `ParserFactory` to dynamically create appropriate parsers
  - **Extensible Design**: Easily add new parser strategies in the future
  - **Enhanced Custom Parser**: Now supports extracting commit type and scope with configurable regex patterns:
    - `--type_pattern`: Extracts commit type (e.g., "feat", "fix")
    - `--scope_pattern`: Extracts commit scope (e.g., "auth", "ui")

  This architecture provides a more flexible and maintainable approach to commit message parsing, allowing users to choose the strategy that best fits their workflow.
